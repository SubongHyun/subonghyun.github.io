Welcome! I'm Subong Hyun, a Ph.D. candidate in Nuclear and Quantum Engineering at KAIST, South Korea. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Hanyang University, followed by an M.S. from KAIST. My research passion lies in advancing X-ray imaging and exploring the intersection of deep learning and medical imaging, with a focus on Computed Tomography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis. Thank you for visiting my webpage!
